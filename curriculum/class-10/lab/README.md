# Module 2: Final API Server

Implement and Deploy a fully functional, tested and documented **Dyanamic API Server** using best practices

**NOTE** - You will be using this server as a base for all future work in this course. Other servers will be merged with it, and we'll be using it to serve data to our front-end applications later in the course. Completion of this final lab is essential to your future work being integrated.

## Before you begin

Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

## Getting Started

## Requirements

- Complete all feature tasks from the previous lab assignments
- Write API tests for every route, asserting proper response codes and data types
- Write unit tests for all of your custom middleware
- Write Model tests for your models, asserting +/- on all CRUD operations
- Add proper **JSDoc** documentation/comments to all of your modules, functions, middleware
- Go to Swagger Hub and create Swagger Documentation for your API
  - Make sure that the model is setup as a parameter, not hard coded as it was for your `json-server`
- Deploy your server properly to Heroku

### Peer Review

- Before you do your final commit to master, invite a classmate to fork your repo and have them do a full review of your code
  - Be open to suggestions
  - Seek more 1:1 information and assistance where you can
- Do the same for another classmate
  - Offer helpful, tactical advice for your classmates. Where can their code improve? Do you see opportunities for clarity/readability?

### Web Server Visual Tests

- Open this [React Application](https://w638oyk7o8.csb.app/)
- In the form at the top of the page, enter the URL to your API Server
- This server is configured to use the routes noted in the first lab requirement
- If your lab is working, this app will show your API Data!
