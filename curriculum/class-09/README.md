# API Server

Express is able to run middleware given the presence of a specific parameter within a router. This gives us the ability to run special code whenever, for example, we an 'id' or a 'model' ... taking advantage of this can give us a great amount of flexibility in our servers.

In evaluating the database side of our server, one of the principle downsides to NoSQL Databases is their decidedly non-relational nature. With Mongoose, however, you can vitually "tie" 2 or more collections together to create a "virtual" join. NoSQL databases are also very capable when they make use of sub-documents to embed schemas within schemas to provide additional articulation. Additionally, we can perform additional operations during the "lifecycle" of our records, giving us the opportunity to inject business logic.
