# 401 Advanced Javascript - Daily Warm-Up Exercises

**Build muscle memory on some the core fundamentals of the language and as a JS developer in general.**

Each day, you should complete the "Daily" warm-up as well as one of the other 4 named warm-up exercises, rotating those each week.

## [Daily Warmup](./daily/)
* Work with arrays, functions, looping, and objects.  Implement spread, deconstruction techniques along with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

### [The Holy Grail](./holy-grail/)
* Implement the "Holy Grail" web layout using Float, Flexbox, and Grid, adding some "flavor" on each subsequent iteration.

### [Async](./async/)
* One of the biggest strengths of Javascript is its use of and prowess at asynchronous actions. At the core of this is Promises and async/await.
* This challenge will have students using Promises and Async to fetch and transform remote dataâ€”actions which are done daily in production level work.

### [Express Server](./express/)
* A qualified JS developer should be able to produce an express server "on demand". This warm-up will have students creating a basic Express server, using TDD which utilizes the core Express components (`get`, `post`, EJS, middleware).

### [React](./react/)
* As a full-stack developer, you should be in constant touch with your front end application building skills. in this warmup, you'll write a React To Do application that utilizes multiple state management tactics and enzyme tests.

### [Data Structures](./dsa/)
* Every data structure has at its base, a means of traversal. Every data structure challenge/question/interview has at its base a requirement that you "do something" while traversing.
* This warm-up exercise is intended to make the traversals trivial so that students can focus solely on the logic that occurs during traversals to solve challenges.
