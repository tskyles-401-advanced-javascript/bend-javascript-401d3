# DESIGN - Grid Layouts

## Assignment
"Grid" based layout systems (not css-grid) are the foundation for a large percentage of today's websites. They are largely based on the concept of dividing a page into a specific number of vertical columns and horizontal rows and then laying out your content in creative ways to span multiple columns and rows to achieve a plethora of layout options.

The major CSS frameworks (bootstrap, material, etc) provide native support for grids, and they're a huge part of most wordpress sites as well. Even with the advent of Cards and Decks, grids will remain a huge part of design implementation

Inspiration: [Grid Systems](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-grid-system-building-a-solid-design-layout) |  [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/grid.html) | [Flexbox Grid SASS](http://hugeinc.github.io/flexboxgrid-sass/)

### Requirements
* Implement a grid system comprised of rows and columns, allowing for spanning of each.
* You may use float, flexbox, or css-grid
* Use mixins and modules in SASS to make this easier to implement and scale.
* Use the inspiration links as inspiration, not as source!
