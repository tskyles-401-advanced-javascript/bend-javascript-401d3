# Async

One of the strengths of the Javascript language is that it's natively asynchronous. Through the use of Callbacks and Promises, JS can easily juggle many tasks simultaneously.

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- How synchronous and asynchronous code runs in the Javascript runtime
- The differences between callbacks and promises
- The significance of error first callbacks
- Testing complexities with asynchronous code

#### Execute

- Manage asynchronous data flow using error first callbacks
- Manage asynchronous data flow using Promises
- Manage asynchronous data flow using async/await
- Utilize the asynchronous methods from built-in NodeJS modules
- Work with raw data using Buffers
- Test asynchronous code with Jest
