# Access Control (ACL)

While **Authentication** answers the question "Who are you?" ... or more specifically "Are you who you say you are?", **Authorization** takes the next step and asks "Are you allowed to do the thing you're asking to do?"

Given a proper and valid user with a set of permissions, we can grant or restict access to anything in our server.
