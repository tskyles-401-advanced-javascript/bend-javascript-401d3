Below you will find some reading material, code samples, and some additional resources that support today's topic and the upcoming lecture.

**For your assignment, go through the reading material and watch/bookmark the additional resources resources provided. Create a wiki entry in your fork of the class repo that summarizes the principle reading topic as though you were presenting the material to a new developer.**

Wiki Entry Ideas:

- Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
- Dictionary / Flash Cards
- Notes in outline form

## Reading

Routes can be managed in separate modules from the main server, allowing us to extract that logic and wiring to be more topical.

How does this change the server's role?

- index.js - Entry Point
- server.js - Hub, Exported Server
- models/categories.js, etc - Data Models
- routes/categories.js, etc - Routers and Handlers
