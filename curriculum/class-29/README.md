# Routing and Component Composition

Apps written using a component framework such as React are generally composed of many components, assembled hierarchically to create a cohesive application. Components very often need to share state(data) and behaviors (methods). In addition to props and state, components can actually render other components as their children.

## Learning Objectives

#### Execute

- Implement React Routing via `<BrowserRouter />`
  - Page Level
  - Component Swapping
- Compose components hierarchically
- Create logical wrapper components
- Create functional wrapper components
- Utilize `children` in composed components
  - Compose the `<List>, <If>` Component
