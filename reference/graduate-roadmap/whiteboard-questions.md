0. implament combine and partial 
0. implament memoize
0. create a function called once that takes a callback and returns a function that when invoked will only call the callback the first time

0. create a functions that will implament push and pop imutably
0. create a function that will imutably implament swap (return new array)
0. create a recursive math.pow function
0. create a recursive function that deeply clone an object
